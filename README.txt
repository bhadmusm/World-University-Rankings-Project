Data Visualisation - Assignment 4 by Maryam Bhadmus

This is the folder containing the files needed to run the Top Ranked Unis processing sketch.
To run the program:

1. Download geomap from this link : http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/giCentre/geomap/geoMap.zip

2. Extract the geomap zip folder in the Processing libraries folder. It should have two folders called 
   _MACOSX and geoMap

3. Open the "A4_TopRankedUnis_BhadmusMaryam" processing source code in processing and 
   it should be able to be run.
