# World University Rankings Project

Data Visualisation Project by Maryam Bhadmus.

The purpose of this project is to present an interactive representation of the world university rankings, based on many different aspects such as reasearch score, citation score and international outlook. 

Developed using Processing and the gicentre geoMap library, the application provides a dynamic visualization of the complex landscape of higher education globally.

## To run the program:

1. Download geomap from this link : http://staff.city.ac.uk/~jwo/giCentre/geomap/geoMap.zip

2. Extract the geomap zip folder in the Processing libraries folder. It should have two folders called 
   _MACOSX and geoMap

3. Open the "A4_TopRankedUnis_BhadmusMaryam" processing source code in processing and 
   it should be able to be run.
